Core Features:

📊 Daily Expense Tracking: Log your expenses with an automatic 24-hour reset, keeping your spending habits up-to-date.

📱 Social Feed: Share spending moments with your followers — from daily essentials to exciting purchases — just like a BeReal for expenses.

🔍 Real-Time Search: Quickly find users and explore their public spending posts.

📈 Insights & Visuals: Get beautiful, interactive visuals to understand your spending patterns over 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months, with the default view showing the last 24 hours.

✅ Private or Public Spending: Most expenses are private, but you can share specific purchases publicly with a photo — for example, a new keyboard, a mouse you’re excited about, or your grocery haul.

🎨 Modern UI: Designed with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface.

In short: Expense Tracker is not just a finance app — it’s a fun, social, and insightful way to manage your money while keeping track of your daily spending habits.
